## Multistore


The Ifthenpay module is compatible with the multistore mode of Magento 2, allowing you to configure different payment methods for each store.
This functionality is applied at the website scope, allowing you to configure different payment methods for each website.

To configure different payment methods for each store, access the module's configuration page and select the desired website in the top left corner (1).

IMPORTANT: When implementing multistore, you should not configure the Default Config, as it will override the websites of the sub-stores. It is only possible to configure different payment methods for each website, and it is not possible to configure different payment methods for each Store View.

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/multiStoreScope.png)
</br>


# Other
  
 ## Request creation of aditional account

If you already have an Ifthenpay account but have not contracted a payment method that you now need, you can make an automatic request to Ifthenpay.

To request the creation of an additional account, access the module's configuration page and click on "Request New Account" for the payment method you wish to contract.

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/requesNewAccount.png)
</br>

In case you need an account for Multibanco with Dynamic References, the "Request New Account" button will be available within the configuration of the Multibanco payment method (1).

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/requestMultibancoDynamic.png)
</br>

By clicking on Request New Account, a dialog box will appear where you can confirm the action by clicking on OK (1).

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/requestAccountConfirm.png)
</br>

You may also request a method for the Ifthenpay Gateway following the same procedure by clicking any of the request buttons (1). 

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/request_gateway_paymen_method.png)
</br>

As a result, the Ifthenpay team will add the payment method to your account, updating the list of available payment methods in your module.

IMPORTANT: When requesting an account for the Credit Card payment method, the Ifthenpay team will contact you to request more information about your online store and your business before activating the payment method.



## Reset Configuration

If you have acquired a new Backoffice Key and want to assign it to your website but already have one currently assigned, you can reset the module's configuration. In the Ifthenpay module configuration, click on the "Clear Backoffice Key" button (1) and confirm the action by clicking OK.

**Attention, this action will clear the current module settings**;

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/clearBackofficeKey.png)
</br>

After clearing the Backoffice Key, you will be prompted to enter the Backoffice Key again.

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/afterClearBackofficeKey.png)
</br>


## Callback

IMPORTANT: Only the Multibanco, MB WAY, Payshop, and Cofidis Pay payment methods allow enabling Callback. The credit card method automatically changes the order status.

Callback is a feature that, when enabled, allows your store to receive a notification of a successful payment. When enabled, upon receiving a successful payment for an order, the Ifthenpay server communicates with your store, changing the order status to "Processing". You can use Ifthenpay payments without enabling Callback, but your orders will not be automatically updated with the status change.

As mentioned above in Configurations, to enable Callback, access the module's configuration page and enable the "Enable Callback" option. After saving the settings, the process of associating your store and payment method with Ifthenpay servers will be executed, and a new element (for informational purposes only) will be displayed, showing the Callback status (1), the anti-phishing key (2), and the Callback URL (3).

After enabling Callback, you don't need to take any further action. Callback is active and functioning.

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/callbackElement.png)
</br>


## Cronjob

A cron job is a scheduled task that is automatically executed at specific intervals in the system. The Ifthenpay module provides a cron job to check the status of payments and cancel orders that have not been paid within the configured time limit. The table below shows the time limit for each payment method, which the cron job checks and cancels orders that have not been paid within the time limit. This time limit can only be configured for the Multibanco with Dynamic References and Payshop payment methods.
Cofidis Pay does not have this functionality because its approval time is not fixed.

| Payment Method     | Payment Deadline           |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Multibanco         | no deadline                |
| Multibanco Dynamic | Configurable, 1 to n days  |
| MB WAY             | 30 minutes                 |
| Payshop            | Configurable, 1 to 99 days |
| Credit Card        | 30 minutes                 |
| Cofidis Pay        | 60 minutes                 |

The order cancellation cronjob runs every minute. The configuration options for the cronjob can be found on the Magento cronjobs settings page under the ifthenpay_payment group.

![img](https://github.com/ifthenpay/magento2/raw/assets/assets/img/cronjobConfiguration.png)
</br>

To start the execution of the cronjob, please access the Magento terminal and run the following command:

```bash
bin/magento cron:run --group ifthenpay_payment
```

## Logs

To facilitate error detection, the Ifthenpay module logs any errors that occur during its execution. The logs are then saved in a text file in the var/log/ directory of Magento. To access the logs, navigate to the var/log/ folder in the root of Magento and open the file ifthenpay.log.

# Consumer User Experience
